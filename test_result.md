## USER PROBLEM STATEMENT
Add functionality that allows users to create multiple campaigns, each with its own session notes stored under a dedicated campaign tab. Enhance the campaign setup process by enabling users to assign players whose names can be auto-referenced in the note template for attendance tracking. Additionally, implement a campaign settings tab that allows users to edit campaign details—such as renaming, adjusting note distribution, and adding or removing players. The goal is to improve usability, organization, and flexibility while integrating seamlessly with the current system.
